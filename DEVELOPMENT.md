Dear Diary,

November 18, 2019
- The day is cloudy with a bit of rain
- Setup building environment and got openframework running
- Commited first push to git
- Started work on importing JSON

November 22, 2019
- The sky is clear today, the air is a little brisky
- Import JSON is working properly
- Need to visualize JSON information
- Decide how to store JSON hiearchy for display
- Start working on outlining UI layout

November 23, 2019
- So excited for the flight back to AZ!
- Created JsonLoader object to better store data regarding json file

November 24, 2019
- First day back home! Got to visit an old neighbor who inspired me to do computer science(He taught me my first language)
- Set up test environment after solving many issues with the xcode compiler(took way longer than it seems it should)
- Wrote first test cases for JsonLoader

November 25, 2019
- Hit the gym back home for the first time today! Feels good to be back.
- Researched about loading images from url's (as that will be the main source for Twitter pictures), got test to work.
- Still researching as to how to divide up the window into sections where different outputs could be visualized

November 26, 2019
- Haven't hit the gym yet, I really shouldn't be slacking back home, but the motivation really is just lacking.
- Tested out Gui panel(specifically the toggle feature of ofxGui) which allows the image and text to be hidden or shown.
- Should start working on event listeners to change the layout of the interface based on the number of features being analyzed on the screen.
