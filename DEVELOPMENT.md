Dear Diary,

November 18, 2019
- The day is cloudy with a bit of rain
- Setup building environment and got openframework running
- Commited first push to git
- Started work on importing JSON

November 22, 2019
- The sky is clear today, the air is a little brisky
- Import JSON is working properly
- Need to visualize JSON information
- Decide how to store JSON hiearchy for display
- Start working on outlining UI layout
