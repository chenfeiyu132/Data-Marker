Dear Diary,

November 18, 2019
- The day is cloudy with a bit of rain
- Setup building environment and got openframework running
- Commited first push to git
- Started work on importing JSON

November 22, 2019
- The sky is clear today, the air is a little brisky
- Import JSON is working properly
- Need to visualize JSON information
- Decide how to store JSON hiearchy for display
- Start working on outlining UI layout

November 23, 2019
- So excited for the flight back to AZ!
- Created JsonLoader object to better store data regarding json file

November 24, 2019
- First day back home! Got to visit an old neighbor who inspired me to do computer science(He taught me my first language)
- Set up test environment after solving many issues with the xcode compiler(took way longer than it seems it should)
- Wrote first test cases for JsonLoader
